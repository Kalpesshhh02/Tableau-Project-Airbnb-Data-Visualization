I'm excited to share my first Tableau project, where I explored and visualized data from Airbnb, a leading international platform for unique lodging experiences. 🌍

## What I Visualized:
- Average Price per Bedroom 🛏️
- Price Trends by Zipcode 📍
- Detailed Price Breakdown by Zipcode 🗺️
- Count of Different Bedroom Types 🏡
- Revenue Trends Over the Years 💰

This project has been a valuable step in my journey of learning data analysis with Tableau. Feel free to explore the visualizations [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBProject_17238093384960/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and check out the dataset I used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset). Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
